    <p class= 'description'> This graffiti has been found in Belsize park. As you can see, it has a Perspex covering!
      Why would it be so precious? There has been a debate on whether Banksy, a famous but anonymous
      artist from Bristol was the author. He apparently denied authorship.
      The graffiti represents Mrs Beechey, who run a hardware shop in Regent's Park Road during 50 years. Apparently,
      she was happy
      to find her picture on the wall, especially because her shoes were well represented!
      But she could not identify the artist neither.
      Of course, everything could be a big joke of Banksy, as stated by
      <a href= "http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2010/09/02/jenny-diski/banksys-granny/"> this website. </a>
    </p>

    <p class = 'description'>

      The mystery raised the debate on who and under which circumstances we could judge graffitis as a piece of art to be preserved,
      rather than an inopportune drawing to be removed.
